    Krishna's Butter Ball is a large, round granite boulder located in Mahabalipuram, Tamil Nadu. It is famous for its unusual positioning, as it appears to be precariously balanced on a small slope, seemingly defying gravity. The rock has been a subject of fascination for centuries and has become one of the most iconic landmarks in Mahabalipuram.

     Key Features:
    - Size and Shape: The massive boulder weighs several tons and measures about 6 meters in diameter.
    - Natural Wonder: The rock is a natural formation and has not been moved or altered; it simply sits at an angle on the ground, which makes it look as though it could roll down at any moment.
    - Historical Significance: The rock is believed to have been named after Lord Krishna, and some local legends say it resembles a ball of butter, referring to the deity's childhood habit of stealing butter.
    - Tourist Attraction: Krishna's Butter Ball has become a popular tourist spot, and visitors often take photos of the unique formation, marveling at its stability.
